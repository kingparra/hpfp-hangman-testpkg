# hangman

A simple hangman like game, intended to serve as notes for the book "Haskell
Programming from First Principles" by Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki. This
program corresponds to sections 13.9 to 13.13 of Chapter 13: Building Projects.

You can find a link to this in my notes at https://hpfp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

I'm uploading this as a package *candidate* only, in order to learn how to use
Cabal and Hackage. If this ever ends up in Hackages main repository -- Sorry!
I'm only a beginner and have no idea what I'm doing.
